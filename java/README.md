### Object-Oriented Programming

<details>
  <summary>Programming Paradigms</summary>

  - Procedural Programming: Focuses on procedures or routines.
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Focuses on objects that contain data and methods.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Class diagrams</summary>

  - Classes: Represented by rectangles with three compartments (name, attributes, methods).
  - Relationships:
    - Association: A "uses-a" relationship.
    - Aggregation: A "has-a" relationship, parts can exist independently.
    - Composition: A "contains-a" relationship, parts cannot exist independently.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Abstraction</summary>

  - Concept: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Classes</summary>

  - Concept: Blueprint for objects. Defines the data and behavior that objects can have.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Objects</summary>

  - Instance: A unique occurrence of a class. Has its own set of data and methods.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Encapsulation</summary>

  - Concept: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Inheritance</summary>

  - Concept: Mechanism where a new class (derived or child class) is created from an existing class (base or parent class).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Polymorphism</summary>

  - Concept: Ability of an object to take on many forms. Allows methods to be defined in multiple ways.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>ENUM</summary>

  - Concept: Special class that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables).
</details>

<details>

  <summary>Interfaces</summary>

  - Concept: Blueprint of a class. Specifies a set of methods that a class must implement.
</details>


<details>
  <summary>OOP Concepts</summary>

  - Coupling: Degree of dependency between classes or modules.
  - Cohesion: Degree to which elements inside a module belong together.
  - Association: Relationship between classes where one class uses the functionalities of another.
  - Aggregation: "Has-a" relationship where one class contains references to another class.
  - Composition: "Contains-a" relationship where one class contains objects of another class.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>SOLID Principles</summary>

  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
  - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality.
  - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
  - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

### Advanced Java

<details>
  <summary>Collections</summary>

  - Frameworks and classes in Java that provide an architecture to store and manipulate groups of objects.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Lambda Functions</summary>

  - Anonymous functions that provide a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Annotations</summary>

- Metadata that provides data about a program but is not part of the program itself, used to provide information to the compiler and to be processed at runtime.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Generics</summary>

- Allows a type or method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Working with Dates</summary>

- Handling date and time using classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, and `DateTimeFormatter` in the `java.time` package.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Exceptions and Error Handling</summary>

- Mechanisms to handle runtime errors, providing a way to react to exceptional circumstances and ensure the program can continue or terminate gracefully.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Functional Programming and Lambda Expressions</summary>

- Paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data, utilizing lambda expressions for cleaner and more concise code.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Threads</summary>

- **Parallel Programming**
  - Running multiple threads simultaneously to perform tasks concurrently, improving performance and efficiency.

- **Concurrent Programming**
  - Managing multiple threads, ensuring they operate correctly and efficiently in an environment where they share resources.
